## Automatic Lyrics Display for Live Musical Performances

### A computational system in Java that follows live musical performances and displays pre-encoded lyrics in real-time. Key features:
1. A multi-threaded audio framework with a shared synchronous buffer to handle simultaneous recording and processing in Java. 
2. Real-time implementation of the dynamic time warping algorithm to align annotated and live temporal sequences, based on their harmonic similarity.
3. GUI to load lyric files and display lyrics in real time

Here is a flowchart overview of the project:
